                 <li>In college we study theoretical part of a subject. Project is is something where you actually learn.</li>
                 <li>A good project makes your resume stronger.</li>
                 <li>You can publish your research paper if your topic invents or concludes something new.</li>
                 <li>If it is a good application oriented project then you can have your own business model.</li>

                    <li>Discuss with your group members.<br>Listen everyones ideas. Discuss about those ideas. Shortlist 2-3 of them.Study them and select one.</li>

                    <li>Fix a good teacher in your project domain well before time. Take his guidance while choosing the topic. </li>

                   <li>Search for the project mates interested in same domain.</li>
                   <li>Search or invent an unique idea in that domain.</li>
                   <li>Highlight the new and creative points in your project to discuss with your guide project mates.</li>
                   <li>Your project should be either an useful product or it should be demonstration of an algorithm developed by you.

               <ul>
                   <li>Project group generally contains 3 to 5 people.</li>
                   <li>After choosing domain start searching for your project mates who wants to do project in the same domain.</li>
                   <li>Generally 3 types of people can be found in project groups:
                       <ol><li>Person who is very serious about project. He plans the flow of project and other people follow him. He is the leader 
of the project.</li>
                           <li>The person having technical ability to work on the particular task and complete it.Generally such kind of people follows the flowchart of project and completes their assigned task.</li>
                           <li>This category contains people who are technically not so strong but can do small tasks.<br> But they can do the other non technical procedures and 
can arrange all the required things. They may help in drafting of the project.</li>
                       </ol>
                   </li>
                   <li>Your group configuration should be like:<br>
                       <br>
                            One person of Type 1
                       <br>
                            Two or three people of type 2
                       <br>
                            Zero or one person of type 3
                   </li>
                   <li>Never have more than one type 1 people in the group.These people are kind of dominating in nature.This may lead to have clashes in group.</li>
                   <li>Have at least two type 2 people.You can manage one type 3 person for your non technical needs. Rather than having two A type guys in a group prefer 
having one type 3 person.</li>
                   <li>In project groups you need to compromise few things.Solve the problems by discussion.Avoid misunderstandings.Maintain the bond between 
group mates.<br>Be a great team! :)</li>

                       <li> Most of the peers will advice you to do as many internship's as you can. But's number of internship does not matter, quality of internship does.
                       <li>Ideally you should do 2 internship's: one after your 2nd year and one after your 3rd year.</li>
                       <li>The one after your 2nd year should be a small and simple one: probably work in your dad's or any relatives company.</li>
                       <li>But the one after your 3rd year bust be of at least 1 month in duration and it should be in your core field.</li>
                       <li>Don't pursue an internship just for the sake of it. Pursue it to learn new things.</li>
                       <li>Also, pursue it in the field which you understand at least a bit.</li>

                      <li>Also, every department has an internship cell. Keep in touch with it also.</li>
                      <li>Talk with your seniors. Ask where did they complete their internship. Talk to alumni as well.</li>
                      <li>Keep an eye on the job and internship fairs as well.</li>
                      <li>An internship in a startup is a cherishable experience. Find some local startups and drop them a mail.</li>
                      <li>You can also register on internship sites as well, but they hardly provide any good opportunities.</li>
