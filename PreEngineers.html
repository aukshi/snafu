    <ul>
        <li>
        You have a logical bend of mind. What I mean by that is, you belive that logic is the only way to solve any problem (For ex. X is because of Y. Not because my dad said so).    
        
        
        <li> You like mathematics and you are good at it (or at least wish to become good at it). Consider little higher level mathematics (differentiation, Integration, etc) . Don't judge yourself on your 10th score (We know how we got it, don't we?).

        <li> you are good at science. Especially Physics. While it may not be applicable to all the branches, but most of the core branches are nothing but applications of Physics.

        <li> you like to solve problems. And a lot of them. Not only real life problems, but also those based on the formulae.

        <li> you think out of box (This is applicable if you want to be a "good" engineer. And trust me, being an average engineer is no fun).

        <li> you like to take challenges.

        <li> you are curious about how the things work.

        <li> You wish to exploit technology to solve most of the problems in your (or others) life.

        <li> you like to work in teams (This is true for other streams too. Having said that, it's much more important for engineering).

        <li> you really want to be an engineer (Yes. This is the most important point. Don't be an engineer cause everybody is being one or your mom/dad/anybody want's you to be an engineer. It should come from your heart or you will regret it later).

        <ul>
            <li> <b>B.Sc.</b>
                <p>
                Don't underestimate this course. A B.Sc. degree followed by a M.Sc. can open up multiple opportunities in research. A B Sc offers you a very promising career and the best part about this is: It takes just 3 years.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>BBA</b> 
                <p>
                    It stands for Bachelor in Business Administration. It is below the level of MBA. This 3 years course from a good college can land you in a good company. Also an MBA followed by a BBA will be a great boost to your career.
                    You can also do a <B>BBA+MBA dual degree</B>. This will save you the efforts of preparing for MBA entrance tests. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>BHM</b>
                <p>
                    It stands for Bachelor in Hotel Management. This 4 year degree is highly job oriented. A BHM from a good college will ensure you a respectable role in Hospitality (Hotel and Travel) industry. While the diploma version of this course is also available, but a degree ensures a complete competence in this field.
                </p>

                    There are multiple courses in this field. They can open your doors for a stellar and proud career in merchant navy.
                </p>

            <li> <b>Research </b>: Institutes like IISER, IUCAA and DRDO provide great research opportunities.
     
            <li> <b>Fashion and Design related courses</b>
                Fashion never goes out of fashion. A few courses in this sector:

           <p><button id="btn3" href="#collapse3" class="w3-btn w3-round-xxlarge nav-toggle3 col-9-0 w3-indigo contentdiv">Myths about Engineering</button></p>

      <div id="collapse3" class="col-9 contentdiv" style="display:none">
          <p>
              If you want to be an engineer for the following reasons, then you better think about your decision again. Cause these myths are not true my dear friend.
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>An engineer definitely gets a placement and most of the engineers earn in lac's.</b>
                  <p>
                      This is the biggest myth and it is completely false. If you are pursuing engineering just for the sake of a great job, you need to know a few facts.
                      <br>
                      Placement depends upon multiple factors: college, branch, market conditions, requirements and your profile.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li> While most of the students in IITs manage to get a good placement, same is not true about other colleges. Student's from tier-II and tier-III colleges struggle to get a job.
                      <li> Placement heavily depends upon your branch. Comp/IT students do get good placements, but conditions are not so good for core branches. Students from such branches often get a job in a software company only, which pays peanuts. Hardly any student gets a job in R&D sector.
                      <li> If the market is suffering from a recession, you might find yourself in a trouble.
                      <li> A company may not have requirements each and every year. And even if they have some, they first prefer top colleges (read IITs).
                      <li> And finally, your profile matters a lot. Especially your grades and communication skills.
                  </ul>
                  
                  
              </li>
              <li> <b>An engineer can repair any electrical/mechanical device.</b>
                  <p>
                      Definitely false.<br>
                      Most of the colleges don't provide much of a practical exposure. While engineer learns about electrical/mechanical devices, most of the community can't repair one. Only those who study on their own (and wreck 1 or 2 gadgets in the process)
                      may repair a few (but not all) equipments.
                  </p>

              <li> <b>They know how to build robots, satellites, cars etc.</b>
                  <p>
                      Nah. Most of us don't. <br>
                      While a few students from very good colleges are involved in designing satellites, other colleges neither enough resources (read funds) nor do they care.
                      But most of the colleges have a Robocon and a SUPRA team, but only a few students (20-30 out of 400-500) are a part of these teams. And the robots and cars we make are not like the ones shown in
                      sci-fi movies or our college brochures. They are very simple and crude.
                  </p>

              <li> <b>If you are software engineer you are a good hacker.</b>
                  <p>
                      Not true at all. Hacking is whole lot of different sector and you don't need to be a software engineer to learn hacking (Hacking is illegal, bdw).
                      Let alone hacking, most of the software engineers are not even good coders.
                  </p>

              <li> <b>You need to study a lot for engineering.</b>
                  <p>
                      You <b>don't</b> need to, but you <b>should</b>.
                      <br>
                      While I truly believe that grades don't matter a lot, but most of the world works otherwise. You will know the importance of grades when you will apply to a job or for higher education. 
                  </p>

              <li><b> Engineering is better than plain sciences.</b>
                  <p>
                      Science and Engineering are completely different courses and both have their advantages and disadvantages. It's an individual choice.
                  </p>
          </ul>
          <p>
              I don't want to discourage you, but every student must be aware of these facts before choosing most the stream he wants to study in. Having said all these things, I still think that engineering is the best thing that happened to me. It teaches you so many things, both technical and non-technical, that you can face almost any problem.

 <div id="collapse6" class="col-9 contentdiv" style="display:none">
     <p>
         While deciding your career as an engineer is hard enough a choice to make, but as you have already cleared that hurdle, let's focus on the second toughest choice: <b>Which college should I choose?</b><br>
         It's really very tough to answer this question and again, it is very subjective. You may join college for it's reputation, while I might consider it's ROI. But there are a few essential factors which you should consider before zeroing in on your college.
         
     </p>
     <ul>
    <li>   <b> Infrastructure: </b><br>
        <p>This is the most important factor while choosing a college. Infrastructure of a college means it's labs, computer labs, workshops, sufficient classrooms, a good auditorium, good eating spaces including at least a decent canteen (you don't find a great canteen in any engineering college),
            enough parking, sufficient open spaces and a ground, if possible. You should also look into availability of lab equipments, computers, lathe machines, etc. And the best source to know about all these things is: of course, current student's of that college.
        </p>
        <li><b>Faculty:</b>
        <p>
            Faculty should be well experienced, sufficiently qualified , concerned about students understanding and updated with recent the development's in their respective fields. You can check their qualifications on the college's site. Again, the best way is to ask the students and alumni.
</p>
    <li>      <b>Placements:</b><br>
        <p>Let's be honest, most of us are more worried about our future company rather than what we may learn in our college days. And if you are one of those people, then you should definitely look into the placement report of the college you want to join.
Gather the information about which companies visit the college for placements, not only annual placements, but for internship's as well. Know about the quality of companies, the sector in which they offer the placement, compensation provided by them, etc. Knowing average salary is not enough. You have to do a thorough analysis of the placement procedure.
        </p>
        <li><b>Location and facilities:</b> 
            <p>Location of the college should be convenient for you because it directly affects your daily lifestyle. While a picturesque location is not expected, but it should be
                at least easily accessible from the nearby city, bus stop/railway station, a good market and of course, from where you are going to stay. Generally a college in a good city attracts good crowd, which means better people to interact with and a better growth of your personality.<br>
             Facilities like hostel, Wi-Fi, library, mess should be available as per your requirement. What I mean by this is, if you are a bibliophile, you should look for a good library.
            </p>
    <li><b>Alumni network: </b>

            The best way to judge a machine is by examining it's output. Similarly, the best way to judge a college is by analyzing it's alumni's career progression. These four years are going to be very important for you.
            You are not going to join a college, you are going to be a part of a culture. So, it's better to understand that culture beforehand.<br>
            Use Linked In and Facebook to track their alumni, ask them how the college and the culture is, meet them if possible. Ask them about their college festivals, faculties, extracurricular's. Don't leave any stone unturned.
